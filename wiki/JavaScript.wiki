#JavaScript function for text hyphenation.

Hardhyphenation is a script used for to break long strings that normally the browsers doesn't know how to deal with. In some cases it will stretch the containig element and in this way will break the layout. In others the string will continue outside of the element and eventually overlaping any other content. Another possible case according to the style rulls applied is the text to be clipped in the end of the element.
