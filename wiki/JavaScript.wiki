#JavaScript function for text hyphenation.

Hardhyphenation is a script used for to break long strings that normally the browsers doesn't know how to deal with. 
 * In some cases it will stretch the containig element and in this way will break the layout. 
 * In others the string will continue outside of the element and eventually overlaping any other content.
